# wiki2map
Interactive mindmap generator for Wikitext-based resources.

## wiki2map 2.0
wiki2map v2.0 is out! The engine has been completely rewritten and the UI given a new, fresher look!
Locale support has been added as well, please contribute to making wiki2map accessible in as many languages as possible!

HTTP GET parameter support is now available to have wiki2map automatically load an article with its UI set up in a (supported) language of choice. For example https://wiki2map.org/index.html?wiki=en.wikipedia.org&topic=Earth&lang=en will load the english Wikipedia article about planet Earth with the UI in english.
New controls have been added and unused ones removed.

Live instance at:  https://wiki2map.org/

Old (v1.0) version can be found at https://old.wiki2map.org or https://wiki2map.org/old, should you prefer it.
